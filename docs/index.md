<h2>Summary:</h2>
The goal for our project is to create an agent that can reach the end of an obstacle course using elytra and fireworks without dying from lava or kinetic energy, or taking too long. Our agent begins by starting off at 15 blocks above the lava. Upon jumping off the spawn block, the agentâ€™s elytra gets activated and they must control their movements and determine when to use fireworks in order to get past all the obstacles across a 100 block distance. For input, the agent enters a 33 x 46 x 100 box with random obstacles generated every time. Our agent is positively rewarded with reaching certain checkpoints over the course and reaching the goal at 100 blocks from the start. Our project is negatively rewarded for touching lava, obstacles, walls, and the ceiling.
