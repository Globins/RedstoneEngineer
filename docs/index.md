<h2>Summary:</h2>
The goal for our project is to create an agent that can reach the end of an obstacle course using elytra and fireworks without dying from lava or kinetic energy, or taking too long. Our agent begins by starting off at 15 blocks above the lava. Upon jumping off the spawn block, the agentâ€™s elytra gets activated and they must control their movements and determine when to use fireworks in order to get past all the obstacles across a 175 block distance. For input, the agent enters a 33 x 46 x 175 box with random obstacles generated diagonally, horizontally, and vertically every time. Our agent is positively rewarded with going in a forward direction over the course and reaching the goal at 175 blocks from the start. Our agent is negatively rewarded for touching lava, obstacles, walls, and the ceiling.

<b> Weekly Meeting Time: </b>
    We plan on meeting at least once a week at this scheduled time: Fridays at 3:30pm PST + any additional appointments we may need to set up with each other in order to complete the project.
